# Python - Abstract Classes & Interfaces

## Description

In object-oriented programming, some classes are used to define a common contract for other classes.

Sometimes a class should define what behavior must exist, but not provide the full implementation itself. In Python, this can be modeled using abstract classes.

An abstract class allows you to define methods that subclasses are expected to implement. This helps create consistent designs where different objects share the same interface while keeping their own specific behavior.

A related concept is the idea of an interface. Python does not have a dedicated interface keyword, but similar results can be achieved using abstract methods or by relying on duck typing: if an object provides the required behavior, it can be used.

In this project, you will work with:

- abstract base classes
- abstract methods
- interface-like design
- duck typing
- subclassing built-in classes
- multiple inheritance
- mixins

These tools are useful when building flexible and reusable software designs.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you should be able to:

- explain the purpose of an abstract class
- use ABC and @abstractmethod
- implement subclasses that satisfy an abstract contract
- understand how Python can model interfaces
- explain and apply duck typing
- extend built-in classes while preserving their behavior
- understand the role of multiple inheritance
- use mixins to add reusable behavior to a class

## Concept Guide

Abstract Classes and Concrete Classes

An abstract class defines behavior that subclasses must implement.

For example, a class may define a method that all subclasses must provide, while leaving the actual implementation to each subclass.

A simplified relationship looks like this:
```
               Animal (Abstract Class)
                         |
                ┌────────┴────────┐
                |                 |
                ▼                 ▼ 
               Dog               Cat
        (Concrete Class)   (Concrete Class)
```

Interpretation:

- Animal defines required behavior
- Dog and Cat provide concrete implementations
- all subclasses share the same contract

Duck Typing

In Python, objects are often used based on what they can do, not only on what they inherit from.

Example idea:

- if an object provides a method named draw(), it may be usable in a function that expects something drawable
- the object does not always need to inherit from a specific class for that use case

This approach is often called duck typing..
